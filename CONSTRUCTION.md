# Model Registry UI Integration

## üéØ Objective
Integrate model registry with UI to provide intelligent model routing and selection for text and vision models, enabling smart communication with Ollama models.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Status

### ‚úÖ Foundation (Complete)
- **Model Registry:** 8 predefined models with capabilities
- **Registry Service:** Interface and implementation complete  
- **WebSocket Infrastructure:** Chat handling with smart routing active
- **Ollama Integration:** Model connection service active

## üìã Implementation Progress

### ‚úÖ Phase 1-2: Model Infrastructure (COMPLETED)
- **Model Registry Contract & Implementation:** `packages/shared/features/connection/model-registry/`
- **Model Selector Infrastructure:** Basic filtering and selection adapters
- **Registry Service Integration:** Full model capability access

### ‚úÖ Phase 3: Smart Model Router (COMPLETED)
**Location:** `packages/shared/features/chat/smart-model-router/`

**Key Features:**
- **Intelligent Content Analysis:** Detects text complexity and capability requirements
- **Vision Detection:** Automatically routes multimodal content to vision models
- **User Preference Support:** Respects preferred text/vision model selections
- **Availability Monitoring:** Real-time model health checking and fallback handling
- **Event-Driven Architecture:** Publishes routing success/failure events

**Components:**
- Contract, implementation, adapters, events, and comprehensive tests

### ‚úÖ Phase 4: UI Components (COMPLETED)
**Location:** `packages/client/src/features/ui/model-selector/` & `packages/client/src/components/`

**Key Features:**
- **React Components:** Model dropdowns, recommendations, and integrated selectors
- **State Management:** Extended Zustand store with model selection and preferences
- **Custom Hooks:** `useModelSelector()` and `useModelRecommendation()`
- **Real-time Updates:** Model availability monitoring and status indicators

### ‚úÖ Phase 5: WebSocket Integration (COMPLETED)
**Location:** `packages/server/src/websocket/websocket-handler.ts`

**Key Features:**
- **Smart Routing Integration:** WebSocket handler uses intelligent content analysis
- **Real-time Model Availability:** Live monitoring and health checking of all models
- **Enhanced Error Handling:** Automatic fallback routing when models fail
- **New WebSocket Events:** Model availability, recommendations, and routing results

**WebSocket Events Added:**
- `models:availability` - Real-time model health status
- `models:list` - Complete model registry access
- `model:recommend` - Content-based model suggestions  
- `model:selected` - Smart routing results with reasoning
- `chat:fallback` - Automatic fallback notifications

### üöÄ Phase 6: Server Integration & Dependency Injection (COMPLETED)
**Location:** `packages/server/src/main.ts` & service initialization

**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: Existing Server Architecture Analysis Required**
Before implementing dependency injection, we must carefully analyze:
- **Current Service Registration:** How existing services are initialized and injected
- **Dependency Graph:** Existing service interdependencies and initialization order
- **Configuration Patterns:** How current services load config and adapters
- **Error Handling:** Existing patterns for service startup failures
- **Testing Infrastructure:** Current service mocking and testing patterns

**Goals:**
- Initialize SmartModelRouter with proper dependencies and adapters
- Update server startup to inject smart router into WebSocket handler  
- Implement missing service dependencies (ensure adapters are available)
- Configure event publishing for routing events
- Test end-to-end smart routing functionality with live Ollama models

**Required Investigation:**
1. **Analyze Current Server Main:** Review existing dependency injection patterns
2. **Service Factory Pattern:** Understand how services are currently instantiated
3. **Adapter Availability:** Verify all smart router adapters are implemented
4. **Event System Setup:** Configure routing event publishers
5. **Integration Testing:** Ensure compatibility with existing Ollama service

## üéØ Registry Models (8 Available)

### Text Models (6 available)
- `phi4:14b` - Standard text generation
- `llama3.2:3b` - Lightweight text generation  
- `phi4-mini:3.8b` - Text + tool use
- `deepseek-r1:14b` - Text + tools + reasoning
- `qwen3:4b` - Text + tools + reasoning
- `gemma3:4b` - Standard text generation

### Vision Models (2 available)  
- `llama3.2-vision:11b` - Vision + text (large)
- `granite3.2-vision:2b` - Vision + text (compact)

## üîß Architecture Principles

- **AI-Native Design:** All files under 200 lines with minimal context
- **Contract-First:** Clear interfaces before implementation  
- **Adapter Pattern:** Clean separation between features and utilities
- **Event-Driven:** Asynchronous communication via events
- **Zero Cross-Dependencies:** Features communicate only via services/events

## ‚úÖ Current Achievements

1. **Smart Routing Engine:** Content-aware model selection implemented
2. **8 Models Categorized:** Proper text/vision separation with capabilities
3. **Intelligent Analysis:** Capability and complexity detection working
4. **Fallback Handling:** Graceful degradation when models unavailable
5. **Health Monitoring:** Real-time availability checking
6. **Event System:** Complete routing event publishing  
7. **React UI Components:** Model selector dropdowns with real-time availability
8. **Smart Recommendations:** Content-aware model suggestions with confidence scoring
9. **State Management:** Extended Zustand store with model selection and preferences
10. **WebSocket Integration:** Smart routing active in chat handler with new events
11. **Enhanced Error Handling:** Automatic fallback routing and recovery
12. **Architecture Compliance:** All components follow AI-native principles

## üéØ Next Milestone

**Phase 6: Server Integration & Dependency Injection** - Carefully analyze existing server architecture, initialize SmartModelRouter with proper dependencies, and ensure seamless integration with current service patterns.
