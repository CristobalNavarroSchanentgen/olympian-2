# Olympian AI-Native Architecture: Model Selector Implementation

## üéØ Current Status
**‚úÖ PHASE 1 COMPLETE:** Backend model selector features are fully integrated and operational.

**‚úÖ PHASE 2 COMPLETE:** Frontend Integration (React components and WebSocket handlers)

**üîÑ CURRENT FOCUS:** Phase 3 - Integration Testing (End-to-end workflow testing)

## üèóÔ∏è AI-Native Architecture Approach

### Core Principle
Every component follows the contract-first, adapter-based pattern:
- **Features** define business logic through contracts
- **Adapters** transform between utilities and feature expectations  
- **Services** provide interface-only communication between features
- **Events** enable async feature communication

### Implementation Strategy
Work feature-by-feature, leveraging contracts to minimize context switching.

## üìä Implementation Progress

### ‚úÖ Phase 1: Service Registration & Dependency Injection (COMPLETE)

**Completed Objectives:**
- Model selector features integrated into server bootstrap
- Proper dependency injection with adapter pattern
- WebSocket handler ready for event emission

**Architecture Achieved:**
- TextModelSelector and VisionModelSelector consume existing ModelRegistryService
- Adapters handle filtering and persistence: text-model-filter, vision-model-filter, selection-persistence, image-detection
- Full contract-based isolation between features
- Event system ready for frontend integration

### ‚úÖ Phase 2: Frontend Integration (COMPLETE)

**‚úÖ COMPLETED:** React components that consume model selector contracts

**Completed Tasks:**
1. **‚úÖ Created UI Components** (packages/client/src/components/model-selector/)
   - TextModelDropdown.tsx - Consumes TextModelSelectorContract
   - VisionModelDropdown.tsx - Consumes VisionModelSelectorContract  
   - ModelSelectorPanel.tsx - Combines both selectors

2. **‚úÖ Created WebSocket Event Handlers** (packages/client/src/hooks/model-selector/)
   - useTextModelSelector.ts - Handles text-model events
   - useVisionModelSelector.ts - Handles vision-model events
   - Subscribe to: text-model-selected, vision-model-selected, model-selection-failed

**Architecture Benefit:** Components only know about contracts, not implementations

### üîÑ Phase 3: Integration Testing (CURRENT FOCUS)

**Objective:** Verify end-to-end model selection workflow

**Success Criteria:**
1. Model dropdowns populate from registry data
2. User selections persist across sessions  
3. Smart routing uses selected models appropriately
4. Real-time updates when model availability changes
5. Error handling with fallback suggestions

**Next Tasks:**
1. **Integrate components into existing UI** - Add ModelSelectorPanel to application layout
2. **Test WebSocket event flow** - Verify backend events reach frontend hooks
3. **Validate model registry integration** - Ensure available models populate correctly
4. **Test persistence layer** - Verify user preferences save/load properly
5. **Integration with smart routing** - Confirm selected models are used for routing

## üîß Current Architecture Status

### Working Infrastructure
- **Model Registry Service:** Provides getAllRegisteredModels() and getModelCapability()
- **Smart Router:** Consumes model selections for routing decisions
- **WebSocket Handler:** Set up for real-time model communication
- **Model Selector Features:** Backend contracts and implementations complete
- **Frontend Components:** TextModelDropdown, VisionModelDropdown, ModelSelectorPanel
- **WebSocket Hooks:** useTextModelSelector, useVisionModelSelector

### Event Flow (Ready for Testing)
```
User selects model ‚Üí Validation ‚Üí Persistence ‚Üí Event emission ‚Üí UI update ‚Üí Smart router integration
```

### Key Files
- **Backend:** packages/server/src/index.ts (service registration complete)
- **Features:** features/ui/{text,vision}-model-selector/ (contracts and implementations complete)
- **Adapters:** adapters/features/ui/ (filtering and persistence adapters complete)
- **Frontend Components:** packages/client/src/components/model-selector/ (Phase 2 complete)
- **Frontend Hooks:** packages/client/src/hooks/model-selector/ (Phase 2 complete)

## üöÄ Next Actions (Phase 3)
1. **Integration Testing** - Add components to main application UI
2. **End-to-end Workflow Testing** - Verify complete model selection pipeline
3. **WebSocket Event Testing** - Confirm backend-frontend event communication
4. **Smart Router Integration** - Test model selection influences routing decisions
5. **Persistence Testing** - Verify user preferences survive app restarts

**Architecture Advantage:** Clear separation between phases allows focused testing of each integration layer independently.
