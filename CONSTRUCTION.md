# Olympian-2 Project Status

## 🎯 Project Overview

Olympian-2 is an AI-native chat application designed with extreme context minimization. Every feature can be understood by reading only its contract file plus at most 2 adapter files. The architecture prioritizes AI developer efficiency over traditional software engineering patterns.

## 🏗️ Architecture Foundation: ✅ COMPLETE (100%)

### ✅ AI-Native Architecture 
- **Manifest-driven development**: Complete feature boundary definitions
- **Contract-first design**: All inter-feature communication via explicit contracts  
- **Adapter pattern**: Transformation layers isolate utilities from business logic
- **Event-driven communication**: Complete asynchronous feature coordination
- **Service interfaces**: Synchronous inter-feature contracts
- **Build system**: Project builds successfully

## 📊 Current Implementation Status

### ✅ Business Logic Layer (Shared Package) - 90% Complete
- **Feature implementations**: All 9 core features implemented in `packages/shared`
- **Contract definitions**: Complete contract files for all features
- **Service interfaces**: All service interfaces defined
- **Event schemas**: All event definitions complete
- **Model types**: Complete type definitions
- **Configuration schemas**: All config schemas defined

**Remaining**: Comprehensive test coverage (test files are empty)

### ✅ Backend Infrastructure - 75% Complete

#### ✅ Recently Completed (Phase 1):
- **Complete REST API Layer**: 6 API modules with full CRUD operations
  - `/api/conversations` - Create, read, update, delete conversations
  - `/api/messages` - Message management with conversation filtering  
  - `/api/artifacts` - Artifact storage and retrieval
  - `/api/mcp` - MCP server management and tool execution
  - `/api/ollama` - Model status and listing
  - `/api/health`, `/api/status` - System health endpoints

- **Service Implementations**: 5 business logic services
  - `ConversationServiceImpl` - In-memory conversation management
  - `MessageServiceImpl` - Message handling and storage
  - `ArtifactServiceImpl` - Artifact management
  - `McpServiceImpl` - MCP integration (stub implementation)
  - `ModelRegistryServiceImpl` - Model definitions and capabilities

- **Dependency Injection Architecture**: Type-safe service contracts with proper separation

#### ⚠️ Remaining Backend Tasks:
1. **Database Integration**: Replace in-memory storage with MongoDB
2. **Real MCP Integration**: Replace stub with actual stdio process management
3. **WebSocket Event Alignment**: Fix `chat:stream` vs `chat:token` mismatch

### ⚠️ Frontend Implementation - 70% Complete

#### ✅ What Works:
- Complete React component structure with Zustand state management
- WebSocket connection handling
- UI styling with Tailwind + custom CSS
- Routing infrastructure (`/chat/:conversationId`)
- File upload handling
- Message bubbles and conversation display

#### ❌ Missing Frontend Elements:
1. **URL-based Conversation Loading**: Extract `conversationId` from routes and load data
2. **API Integration**: Connect React components to new REST endpoints
3. **Error Handling**: Proper error states for API failures
4. **MCP Tool UI**: Connect tool interface to backend execution

## 🎯 Current Development Phase: Phase 2 - Frontend Integration

### 🚨 Priority 1: Frontend-Backend Connection
**Immediate blockers preventing full app function:**

1. **URL-based Navigation** 
   - Routes exist but don't extract conversation ID from URL
   - All routes render same `<DualPaneLayout />` regardless of conversation
   - **Fix**: Add conversation ID extraction and data loading logic

2. **API Integration**
   - Frontend expects REST APIs that now exist on backend
   - **Fix**: Update frontend API calls to use new endpoints
   - **Fix**: Add proper error handling for API responses

3. **WebSocket Events**
   - Frontend expects: `chat:token`, `chat:complete`  
   - Backend emits: `chat:stream`, `chat:complete`
   - **Fix**: Align event naming between frontend and backend

### 🎯 Priority 2: Data Persistence
4. **Database Integration**
   - Current: In-memory storage (data lost on restart)
   - **Target**: MongoDB integration for persistent storage
   
5. **Real-time Chat Flow**
   - **Target**: End-to-end message flow from UI → API → WebSocket → Ollama

## 📋 Implementation Roadmap

### 🔥 Phase 2: Frontend Integration (Current Phase)
**Goal**: Connect frontend to working backend APIs
- [ ] Extract conversation ID from URL parameters
- [ ] Load conversation data on route changes  
- [ ] Connect React components to REST endpoints
- [ ] Fix WebSocket event naming alignment
- [ ] Test complete conversation creation and loading flow

### 🔧 Phase 3: Database & Persistence 
**Goal**: Replace in-memory storage with persistent database
- [ ] MongoDB integration for conversations, messages, artifacts
- [ ] Data migration utilities
- [ ] Backup and recovery procedures

### 🚀 Phase 4: Advanced Features
**Goal**: Complete feature set with MCP integration
- [ ] Real MCP stdio process management
- [ ] Tool discovery and execution
- [ ] Artifact management system
- [ ] Image processing pipeline
- [ ] Performance optimizations

### 🧪 Phase 5: Testing & Polish
**Goal**: Production readiness
- [ ] Comprehensive test coverage for all features  
- [ ] Error handling and edge cases
- [ ] Performance monitoring
- [ ] Security hardening

## 🔧 Development Status Summary

**✅ Ready**: Architecture, backend APIs, UI components
**🔥 In Progress**: Frontend-backend integration (Phase 2)
**⏳ Upcoming**: Database persistence, MCP integration

**Estimated time to basic functionality**: 3-5 days (Phase 2 completion)
**Estimated time to full functionality**: 2-3 weeks (all phases)

## 🎯 Next Immediate Actions

1. **Fix URL-based conversation loading** in frontend router
2. **Connect React stores** to new REST API endpoints  
3. **Align WebSocket events** between frontend and backend
4. **Test conversation creation** and message flow end-to-end
5. **Add error handling** for API failures

The critical backend API blocker has been resolved. Focus is now on connecting the existing frontend to the working backend services.
