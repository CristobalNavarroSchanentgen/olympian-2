# Olympian-2 AI-Native Codebase Status

## üéØ Project Overview

Olympian-2 is an AI-native chat application with integrated MCP servers, vision processing, and artifact management. The architecture prioritizes context minimization - every feature can be understood by reading at most 3 files.

## ‚úÖ CURRENT STATUS: INFRASTRUCTURE FOUNDATION COMPLETE

### What is Implemented

**‚úÖ Business Logic (96 TypeScript files)**
- Models (13 files): Pure TypeScript interfaces
- Utils (10 files): Pure functions for token counting, context management, MCP protocol  
- Events (10 files): Fire-and-forget event schemas
- Services (8 files): Promise-based interfaces for external dependencies
- Config (9 files): Feature configuration schemas with validation
- Adapters (19 files): Feature-specific transformers (1 per feature, no sharing)
- Features (27 files): 9 complete feature implementations with contracts and tests

**‚úÖ Infrastructure Foundation (20 files)**
- Monorepo structure: /packages/client, /packages/server, /packages/shared
- Docker setup: docker-compose.yml with MongoDB replica set, server, client
- Package configurations: TypeScript, dependencies for all 3 packages  
- Build system: Makefile, npm scripts, workspace setup
- Database: MongoDB with replica set, indexes, initialization scripts
- Server foundation: Express setup with Socket.IO, MCP manager integration

**‚úÖ Development Tooling**
- Interactive setup script for Ollama URL, MCP tokens, model detection
- Docker multi-container deployment with single command
- Development and production build pipelines
- MongoDB replica set with proper authentication

### Features Ready
- conversation-manager: CRUD, real-time updates, search
- message-processor: Processing, streaming, Ollama integration
- memory-manager: Context optimization, token budgets
- server-manager: MCP process lifecycle, health monitoring  
- tool-executor: Tool discovery, execution, security
- ollama-connector: Connection management, model operations
- model-detector: Capability detection, vision testing
- image-processor: Upload, processing, vision integration
- artifact-manager: Creation, versioning, validation

## üöß WHAT IS MISSING: SERVICE IMPLEMENTATIONS & UI

### Missing Server Services (High Priority)
- Database service: Real MongoDB adapter implementations
- MCP Manager: Actual stdio process spawning and management
- WebSocket handler: Real-time chat streaming implementation
- API routes: REST endpoints for all features
- Real adapters: Replace mock adapters with actual implementations

### Missing Frontend (High Priority)  
- React components: Chat interface, configuration panels
- Real-time UI: WebSocket integration, streaming display
- File management: Drag-and-drop, image previews
- Configuration UI: MCP management, model detection
- State management: Zustand stores for all features

### Missing Integration (Medium Priority)
- End-to-end testing
- Error handling and logging
- Performance optimization
- Security hardening

## üìä Progress Metrics
- Business Logic: 100% complete ‚úÖ
- Architecture: 100% complete ‚úÖ  
- Infrastructure: 80% complete üü° (foundation done, services needed)
- Frontend: 0% (ready to implement)
- Overall Project: ~60% complete

## üöÄ Next Steps (Prioritized)
1. **Server Services** (2-3 hours)
   - DatabaseService with real MongoDB operations
   - MCPManager with stdio process management
   - WebSocketHandler for real-time chat
   - API routes connecting features to HTTP endpoints

2. **Frontend Implementation** (4-5 hours)
   - React chat interface with streaming
   - Configuration panels for MCP and models
   - Image upload and artifact display
   - Real-time WebSocket integration

3. **Integration & Testing** (1-2 hours)
   - End-to-end chat workflow
   - MCP tool execution testing
   - Error handling and edge cases

## üéØ Architecture Status
‚úÖ Context minimization achieved
‚úÖ Perfect feature isolation  
‚úÖ Immutable contracts defined
‚úÖ Business logic complete
‚úÖ Infrastructure foundation complete
üü° Service implementations needed
‚ùå UI implementation needed

Ready for service implementation phase.
