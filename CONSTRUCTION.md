# Olympian AI-Native Architecture: Model Selector Implementation

## 🎯 Current Status
**✅ PHASE 1 COMPLETE:** Backend model selector features fully integrated and operational  
**✅ PHASE 2 COMPLETE:** Frontend components and WebSocket handlers implemented  
**🔄 PHASE 3 IN PROGRESS:** UI Integration and End-to-End Testing

---

## 🏗️ AI-Native Architecture Foundation

### Core Principle
Every component follows the contract-first, adapter-based pattern:
- **Features** define business logic through contracts
- **Adapters** transform between utilities and feature expectations  
- **Services** provide interface-only communication between features
- **Events** enable async feature communication

### Implementation Strategy
Build feature-by-feature, leveraging contracts to minimize context switching.

## 📊 Implementation Progress

### ✅ Phase 1: Backend Foundation (COMPLETE)
- TextModelSelector and VisionModelSelector features with full contract isolation
- Adapters: text-model-filter, vision-model-filter, selection-persistence, image-detection
- WebSocket events: text-model-selected, vision-model-selected, model-selection-failed
- Service registration in server bootstrap

### ✅ Phase 2: Frontend Components (COMPLETE)
- WebSocket hooks: useTextModelSelector, useVisionModelSelector
- UI components: TextModelDropdown, VisionModelDropdown, ModelSelectorPanel
- Contract-based component isolation
- Event-driven frontend-backend communication

### 🔄 Phase 3: Integration & Testing (IN PROGRESS)

**Current Milestone: UI Integration**
- ✅ Application structure analyzed (App.tsx → DualPaneLayout → Sidebar)
- ✅ ModelSelectorPanel integration point identified (Sidebar component)
- ✅ Sidebar.tsx backup created for safe modification
- 🔄 **ACTIVE TASK:** Complete Sidebar.tsx modification with ModelSelectorPanel
- ⏳ **NEXT:** Test model selector UI functionality and WebSocket events

**Integration Design:**
```
Sidebar Header:
├── Title + Connection Status  
├── New Chat Button
├── 🆕 Models Section (Collapsible)
│   ├── Settings Icon + "Models" + Chevron
│   └── ModelSelectorPanel (when expanded)
└── Conversations List
```

## 🚀 Remaining Phase 3 Tasks

### 1. UI Integration (Current)
- Complete Sidebar.tsx modification
- Test collapsible Models section visibility
- Verify component rendering

### 2. Event Flow Validation
- Test backend-frontend WebSocket communication
- Verify model selection events reach frontend hooks
- Validate error handling flows

### 3. End-to-End Workflow
- Test model dropdown population from registry
- Verify user selection persistence
- Confirm smart router integration

### 4. Final Validation
- Real-time model availability updates
- Session persistence across browser restarts
- Graceful error handling and fallbacks

## 🔧 Architecture Status

### Event Flow Pipeline
```
User Selection → Backend Validation → Persistence → Event Emission → Frontend Update → Smart Router Integration
```

### Working Infrastructure
- **Backend:** Contract-based model selector features
- **Frontend:** React components with WebSocket event handling  
- **Event System:** Backend-to-frontend event bridge
- **Model Registry:** Service providing available models
- **Smart Router:** Ready for model selection integration

---

**Next Interaction:** Complete Sidebar.tsx modification to integrate ModelSelectorPanel with collapsible UI.
