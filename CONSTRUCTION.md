# Olympian-2 Project Status

## 🎯 Project Overview

Olympian-2 is an AI-native chat application built with extreme context minimization architecture. Every feature is understandable by reading only its contract file plus minimal adapter files. The codebase prioritizes AI developer efficiency over traditional patterns.

## 🏗️ Architecture Foundation: ✅ COMPLETE

- **AI-Native Architecture**: Contract-first design with manifest-driven development
- **Minimal Context**: Each component understandable in isolation  
- **Service Interfaces**: Clean separation between features via explicit contracts
- **Event-Driven Communication**: Asynchronous coordination between features
- **Adapter Pattern**: Transformation layers isolate utilities from business logic

## 📊 Current Implementation Status

### ✅ Business Logic (Shared Package) - COMPLETE
- **9 Core Features**: Complete implementations in packages/shared
- **Contract Definitions**: All feature contracts defined and implemented
- **Service Interfaces**: Complete interface definitions with full implementations
- **Event Schemas**: All event types defined
- **Type Models**: Complete type system with proper interface compliance
- **Configuration**: All config schemas ready

### ✅ Frontend - COMPLETE
- **React + Zustand**: Complete component structure with state management
- **URL Navigation**: Conversation loading from routes
- **API Integration**: Connected to all backend REST endpoints
- **WebSocket Integration**: Real-time messaging with proper event handling
- **UI System**: Tailwind styling with responsive design
- **Message System**: Chat bubbles, streaming support, file upload
- **Error Handling**: Proper error states and navigation

### ✅ Backend Infrastructure - COMPLETE
- **REST API Layer**: 6 complete API modules
  - `/api/conversations` - Full CRUD operations
  - `/api/messages` - Message management with filtering  
  - `/api/artifacts` - Artifact storage and retrieval
  - `/api/mcp` - MCP server management
  - `/api/ollama` - Model status and listing
  - `/api/health`, `/api/status` - System monitoring

- **WebSocket Handler**: Real-time communication with proper event handling

- **Service Layer**: All core business logic implementations complete
  - ✅ **ConversationServiceImpl** - Full conversation management
  - ✅ **MessageServiceImpl** - Complete message handling with all interface methods
  - ✅ **ArtifactServiceImpl** - Full artifact management including versioning, search, validation
  - ✅ **McpServiceImpl** - Complete MCP server management (stub implementation)
  - ✅ **ModelRegistryServiceImpl** - Model capability management with registry mode

## 🎯 Development Phases - Current Status

### ✅ Phase 1: Architecture Foundation - COMPLETE
- AI-native architecture implemented
- Service contracts and interfaces defined
- Build system and project structure established

### ✅ Phase 2: Core Integration - COMPLETE  
- Frontend-backend API integration
- Real-time WebSocket communication
- URL-based navigation
- End-to-end message flow

### ✅ Phase 2.5a: TypeScript Syntax - COMPLETE
- Fixed all TypeScript syntax errors
- Corrected method signatures for all services
- Resolved import path issues
- All service method signatures match interfaces

### ✅ Phase 2.5b: Interface Implementations - COMPLETE
- **ArtifactServiceImpl**: Added 7 missing methods (listArtifacts, getArtifactVersions, createVersion, restoreToVersion, validateArtifact, searchArtifacts, getArtifactCount)
- **McpServiceImpl**: Added 8 missing methods (restartServer, getServerStatus, getAllServerStatuses, getAvailableTools, getServerTools, isServerHealthy, getServerConfig, updateServerConfig)
- **ModelRegistryServiceImpl**: Fixed validateModelAccess return type, added isRegistryMode method
- All TypeScript compilation errors resolved
- Both client and server packages building successfully

## 🚀 Next Major Milestone: Phase 3 - Database Integration

**Current Storage**: In-memory maps (data lost on restart)  
**Target**: MongoDB persistence with data retention  
**Time Estimate**: 1-2 days  
**Priority**: High - Required for production deployment

**Tasks**:
- MongoDB integration and connection management
- Replace in-memory storage with database operations
- Data persistence across server restarts
- Database indexing for performance
- Migration scripts for existing data structures

### 🎯 Future Phases

**Phase 4: Advanced Features** (3-5 days)
- Real MCP stdio process management (replace stub implementations)
- Tool discovery and execution pipeline
- Advanced artifact management features
- Performance optimizations and caching

**Phase 5: Production Readiness** (2-3 days)
- Environment configuration
- Error handling and logging
- Security hardening
- Docker deployment setup

## 🎉 Current Status Summary

**✅ FULLY FUNCTIONAL**:
- Complete end-to-end chat application
- Real-time messaging with WebSocket
- Artifact creation and management
- URL-based conversation navigation
- All service interfaces properly implemented
- TypeScript compilation successful for all packages

**🔧 CURRENT IMPLEMENTATION**:
- In-memory storage (development/testing ready)
- Stub MCP implementations (functional but limited)
- File-based configuration

**🚀 READY FOR**:
- Phase 3: Database integration
- Production deployment preparation
- Advanced feature development

**⏱️ DEVELOPMENT TIMELINE**:
- **Phase 3** (Database): 1-2 days → Production-ready persistence
- **Phase 4** (Advanced): 3-5 days → Full feature completeness  
- **Phase 5** (Production): 2-3 days → Deployment ready

**🎯 TOTAL ESTIMATED TIME TO PRODUCTION**: 6-10 days remaining

## 🏆 Key Achievements

1. **Architecture Excellence**: AI-native codebase with minimal context requirements
2. **Full Type Safety**: Complete TypeScript compliance across all packages
3. **Real-time Communication**: WebSocket integration working end-to-end
4. **Service Completeness**: All 17+ interface methods implemented across 5 core services
5. **Build System**: Both client and server packages compile and build successfully
6. **API Completeness**: All 6 REST API modules functional with proper error handling

The foundation is solid and complete. Ready to scale to production-grade persistence and advanced features.
