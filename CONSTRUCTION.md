# Olympian AI-Native Architecture: Model Selector Implementation

## 🎯 Current Status
**✅ PHASE 1 COMPLETE:** Backend model selector features are fully integrated and operational.

**🔄 CURRENT FOCUS:** Phase 2 - Frontend Integration (React components and WebSocket handlers)

## 🏗️ AI-Native Architecture Approach

### Core Principle
Every component follows the contract-first, adapter-based pattern:
- **Features** define business logic through contracts
- **Adapters** transform between utilities and feature expectations  
- **Services** provide interface-only communication between features
- **Events** enable async feature communication

### Implementation Strategy
Work feature-by-feature, leveraging contracts to minimize context switching.

## 📊 Implementation Progress

### ✅ Phase 1: Service Registration & Dependency Injection (COMPLETE)

**Completed Objectives:**
- Model selector features integrated into server bootstrap
- Proper dependency injection with adapter pattern
- WebSocket handler ready for event emission

**Architecture Achieved:**
- TextModelSelector and VisionModelSelector consume existing ModelRegistryService
- Adapters handle filtering and persistence: text-model-filter, vision-model-filter, selection-persistence, image-detection
- Full contract-based isolation between features
- Event system ready for frontend integration

### 🔄 Phase 2: Frontend Integration (IN PROGRESS)

**Objective:** Create React components that consume model selector contracts

**Tasks:**
1. **Create UI Components** (packages/client/src/components/model-selector/)
   - TextModelDropdown.tsx - Consumes TextModelSelectorContract
   - VisionModelDropdown.tsx - Consumes VisionModelSelectorContract  
   - ModelSelectorPanel.tsx - Combines both selectors

2. **WebSocket Event Handlers** (packages/client/src/hooks/)
   - useTextModelSelector.ts - Handles text-model events
   - useVisionModelSelector.ts - Handles vision-model events
   - Subscribe to: text-model-selected, vision-model-selected, model-selection-failed

**Architecture Benefit:** Components only know about contracts, not implementations

### 📅 Phase 3: Integration Testing (UPCOMING)

**Objective:** Verify end-to-end model selection workflow

**Success Criteria:**
1. Model dropdowns populate from registry data
2. User selections persist across sessions  
3. Smart routing uses selected models appropriately
4. Real-time updates when model availability changes
5. Error handling with fallback suggestions

## 🔧 Current Architecture Status

### Working Infrastructure
- **Model Registry Service:** Provides getAllRegisteredModels() and getModelCapability()
- **Smart Router:** Consumes model selections for routing decisions
- **WebSocket Handler:** Set up for real-time model communication
- **Model Selector Features:** Backend contracts and implementations complete

### Event Flow (Ready)
```
User selects model → Validation → Persistence → Event emission → UI update → Smart router integration
```

### Key Files
- **Backend:** packages/server/src/index.ts (service registration complete)
- **Features:** features/ui/{text,vision}-model-selector/ (contracts and implementations complete)
- **Adapters:** adapters/features/ui/ (filtering and persistence adapters complete)
- **Frontend:** packages/client/src/ (components and hooks to be created)

## 🚀 Next Actions
1. **Create React components** for model selection UI
2. **Implement WebSocket event handlers** for real-time updates
3. **Test end-to-end workflow** from UI to backend
4. **Integrate with existing smart routing** for seamless model switching

**Architecture Advantage:** Backend foundation is solid with clear contracts. Frontend development can proceed independently with well-defined interfaces.
