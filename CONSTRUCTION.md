# Olympian AI-Native Architecture: Model Selector Implementation

## 🎯 Current Status
**✅ PHASE 1 COMPLETE:** Backend model selector features fully integrated and operational  
**✅ PHASE 2 COMPLETE:** Frontend components and WebSocket handlers implemented  
**🔄 CURRENT FOCUS: Phase 3 - Task 1: UI Integration (IN PROGRESS)

## 🏗️ AI-Native Architecture Foundation

### Core Principle
Every component follows the contract-first, adapter-based pattern:
- **Features** define business logic through contracts
- **Adapters** transform between utilities and feature expectations  
- **Services** provide interface-only communication between features
- **Events** enable async feature communication

### Implementation Strategy
Build feature-by-feature, leveraging contracts to minimize context switching.

## 📊 Implementation Progress

### ✅ Phase 1: Backend Service Registration (COMPLETE)

**Architecture Delivered:**
- TextModelSelector and VisionModelSelector features integrated into server bootstrap
- Adapters handle filtering and persistence: text-model-filter, vision-model-filter, selection-persistence, image-detection
- WebSocket event emission ready: text-model-selected, vision-model-selected, model-selection-failed
- Full contract-based isolation between features

**Key Files:**
- Backend features: `features/ui/{text,vision}-model-selector/`
- Adapters: `adapters/features/ui/{text,vision}-model-selector/`
- Service registration: `packages/server/src/index.ts`

### ✅ Phase 2: Frontend Integration (COMPLETE)

**Components Delivered:**
1. **WebSocket Event Handlers:** `packages/client/src/hooks/model-selector/`
   - `useTextModelSelector.ts` - Handles text-model-selected events
   - `useVisionModelSelector.ts` - Handles vision-model-selected events
   - Both subscribe to model-selection-failed for error handling

2. **UI Components:** `packages/client/src/components/model-selector/`
   - `TextModelDropdown.tsx` - Consumes TextModelSelectorContract
   - `VisionModelDropdown.tsx` - Consumes VisionModelSelectorContract  
   - `ModelSelectorPanel.tsx` - Unified interface combining both selectors

**Architecture Compliance:**
- Components only know about contracts, not implementations
- WebSocket events bridge backend features to frontend
- Clean separation between text and vision model selection

### 🔄 Phase 3: Integration Testing (CURRENT FOCUS)

**⚡ CURRENT MILESTONE: UI Integration - Sidebar ModelSelector Integration**

**Progress Update:**
- ✅ Component structure analyzed (App.tsx, DualPaneLayout.tsx, Sidebar.tsx)
- ✅ ModelSelectorPanel component verified and ready for integration
- ✅ Sidebar.tsx backed up for safe modification
- 🔄 IN PROGRESS: Integrating ModelSelectorPanel into Sidebar with collapsible interface
- ⏳ NEXT: Complete Sidebar modification and test model selector visibility

**Implementation Approach:**
- Adding collapsible "Models" section to Sidebar header
- Integrating TextModelSelector and VisionModelSelector hooks
- Maintaining clean UI/UX with existing Sidebar design patterns

**Objective:** Validate complete end-to-end model selection workflow

**Success Criteria:**
1. ✅ Components integrated into main application UI
2. ✅ WebSocket events flow from backend to frontend hooks
3. ✅ Model dropdowns populate from registry data
4. ✅ User selections persist across sessions
5. ✅ Smart routing uses selected models appropriately
6. ✅ Real-time availability updates work correctly
7. ✅ Error handling with fallback suggestions

**Next Tasks:**
1. **UI Integration** - Add ModelSelectorPanel to application layout
2. **Event Flow Testing** - Verify backend-frontend WebSocket communication
3. **Model Registry Validation** - Test model population from registry service
4. **Persistence Testing** - Verify user preferences save/load correctly
5. **Smart Router Integration** - Confirm model selections influence routing decisions

## 🔧 Current Architecture Status

### Working Infrastructure
- **Backend:** Model selector features with full contract implementation
- **Frontend:** React components with WebSocket event handling
- **Event System:** Backend emits events, frontend hooks consume them
- **Model Registry:** Service provides available models to selectors
- **Smart Router:** Ready to consume model selection preferences

### Event Flow Pipeline
```
User Selection → Backend Validation → Persistence → Event Emission → Frontend Update → Smart Router Integration
```

## 🚀 Phase 3 Implementation Plan

### 1. UI Integration
Add ModelSelectorPanel to main application interface for user access.

### 2. End-to-End Testing
Verify complete workflow from user interaction to smart routing integration.

### 3. Persistence Validation  
Test user preferences survive application restarts and browser sessions.

### 4. Real-Time Updates
Confirm model availability changes propagate to UI immediately.

### 5. Error Handling
Validate graceful fallbacks when models become unavailable.

**Architecture Advantage:** Clean phase separation allows focused testing of each integration layer independently. The contract-first approach ensures minimal context requirements for each component.
