# Olympian-2 Construction Status

## üéØ Project Overview

Olympian-2 is an AI-native chat application designed with extreme context minimization. Every feature can be understood by reading only its contract file plus at most 2 adapter files. The architecture prioritizes AI developer efficiency over traditional software engineering patterns.

## üèóÔ∏è AI-Native Architecture Status

## üìä Current Implementation Status

### ‚úÖ Fully Implemented Features

**Core Chat System**
- `conversation-manager` - Complete with DB persistence
- `message-processor` - Ollama integration working
- `memory-manager` - Context optimization implemented

**MCP Integration**
- `server-manager` - Process lifecycle management complete
- `tool-executor` - Tool discovery and execution working

**Connection Management**
- `ollama-connector` - Health monitoring and model ops
- `model-detector` - Capability detection implemented
- `model-registry` - Model catalog management

**Content Processing**
- `vision/image-processor` - Upload and processing complete
- `artifacts/artifact-manager` - Creation and versioning

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Partially Implemented Features

**Frontend UI Layer (60% complete)**
- Basic React components exist but don't follow AI-native patterns
- Missing feature-specific adapters
- No proper service integration
- Event system not connected to UI

### ‚ùå Missing Critical Frontend Features

**AI-Native UI Features**
- `features/ui/dual-pane-layout/` - Only contract exists, implementation missing
- `features/ui/reasoning-panel/` - Completely missing from shared/features
- UI feature adapters missing:
  - `layout-persistence-adapter`
  - `theme-adapter` 
  - `reasoning-data-adapter`

**Feature-Specific Frontend Components**
- Model selection UI (no frontend for model-detector/registry)
- MCP server management UI (no frontend for server-manager)
- Tool execution results visualization (no frontend for tool-executor)
- Vision upload interface (no frontend for image-processor)
- Artifact management UI (no frontend for artifact-manager)
- Connection health indicators (no frontend for health monitoring)

**Frontend Service Integration**
- Layout service for dual-pane persistence
- Code editor service for artifact editing  
- Reasoning service for reasoning panel data
- Theme service for consistent theming

**Event System Frontend Integration**
- UI components don't subscribe to AI-native events
- No layout change event handling
- No theme switch event propagation
- No reasoning expand/collapse events
- No model detection event updates
- No server status event visualization

## üéØ Next Implementation Priorities

### Phase 1: AI-Native UI Migration (High Priority)
1. **Migrate existing UI components to AI-native architecture**
   - Move UI logic to `packages/shared/features/ui/`
   - Create proper contracts for each UI feature
   - Implement missing adapters

2. **Complete reasoning panel feature**
   - Implement `features/ui/reasoning-panel/` in shared
   - Create reasoning-data-adapter
   - Connect to frontend component

3. **Complete dual-pane layout feature**
   - Implement missing layout persistence adapter
   - Connect to existing DualPaneLayout component

### Phase 2: Core Feature Frontend Integration (High Priority)
1. **Model Management UI**
   - Create frontend for model-detector feature
   - Add model selection interface
   - Connect to model-registry data

2. **MCP Tool Results Visualization**
   - Create frontend for tool-executor results
   - Add tool execution progress indicators
   - Display tool outputs properly

3. **Connection Health UI**
   - Create frontend for health monitoring
   - Add connection status indicators
   - Display server management status

### Phase 3: Enhanced Features (Medium Priority)
1. **Artifact Management UI**
   - Create frontend for artifact-manager
   - Add artifact versioning interface
   - Enable artifact editing capabilities

2. **Vision Interface Enhancement**
   - Create proper frontend for image-processor
   - Add image upload interface
   - Display processing results

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Debt to Address

### Frontend Architecture Compliance
- Current React components bypass AI-native patterns
- Need to implement proper service layer integration
- Missing event subscription patterns
- Configuration management not following feature patterns

### Missing Adapters
- Theme persistence adapter
- Layout configuration adapter
- UI state management adapters
- Frontend service adapters

## üìà Completion Status

**Overall Project: 75% Complete**

- **Backend Infrastructure**: 100% ‚úÖ
- **Business Logic (Shared)**: 95% ‚úÖ
- **AI-Native Architecture**: 80% ‚úÖ
- **Frontend Components**: 60% ‚ö†Ô∏è
- **Frontend AI-Native Integration**: 20% ‚ùå
- **Event System Integration**: 30% ‚ùå

## üéØ Success Criteria for Completion

To achieve true "AI-native" status, the frontend must:

1. **Follow contract-first development** - All UI features must have contracts in shared/features
2. **Use adapter pattern** - All external dependencies go through adapters
3. **Subscribe to events** - UI responds to feature events, not direct state changes
4. **Service integration** - UI calls features through service interfaces
5. **Context minimization** - Any UI feature understandable with ‚â§3 files

## üöÄ Deployment Status

**Current State**: Backend fully functional, frontend partially functional
- Basic chat works but lacks advanced features
- MCP integration works but no UI management
- Vision processing works but no proper upload UI
- Artifact system works but no management interface

**Target State**: Complete AI-native frontend with all features accessible via UI

## üìã Immediate Actions Required

1. **Audit existing frontend components** against AI-native patterns
2. **Implement missing UI features** in shared/features
3. **Create missing adapters** for frontend integrations
4. **Connect event system** to UI components
5. **Implement service layer** in frontend

The backend is solid and production-ready. The challenge is completing the frontend to match the AI-native architecture quality of the backend system.
