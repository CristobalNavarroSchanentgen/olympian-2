# Olympian AI-Native Architecture: Model Selector Implementation

## üéØ Current Status
**‚úÖ PHASE 1 COMPLETE:** Backend model selector features fully integrated and operational  
**‚úÖ PHASE 2 COMPLETE:** Frontend components and WebSocket handlers implemented  
**üîÑ CURRENT FOCUS: Phase 3 - Task 1: UI Integration (IN PROGRESS)

## üèóÔ∏è AI-Native Architecture Foundation

### Core Principle
Every component follows the contract-first, adapter-based pattern:
- **Features** define business logic through contracts
- **Adapters** transform between utilities and feature expectations  
- **Services** provide interface-only communication between features
- **Events** enable async feature communication

### Implementation Strategy
Build feature-by-feature, leveraging contracts to minimize context switching.

## üìä Implementation Progress

### ‚úÖ Phase 1: Backend Service Registration (COMPLETE)

**Architecture Delivered:**
- TextModelSelector and VisionModelSelector features integrated into server bootstrap
- Adapters handle filtering and persistence: text-model-filter, vision-model-filter, selection-persistence, image-detection
- WebSocket event emission ready: text-model-selected, vision-model-selected, model-selection-failed
- Full contract-based isolation between features

**Key Files:**
- Backend features: `features/ui/{text,vision}-model-selector/`
- Adapters: `adapters/features/ui/{text,vision}-model-selector/`
- Service registration: `packages/server/src/index.ts`

### ‚úÖ Phase 2: Frontend Integration (COMPLETE)

**Components Delivered:**
1. **WebSocket Event Handlers:** `packages/client/src/hooks/model-selector/`
   - `useTextModelSelector.ts` - Handles text-model-selected events
   - `useVisionModelSelector.ts` - Handles vision-model-selected events
   - Both subscribe to model-selection-failed for error handling

2. **UI Components:** `packages/client/src/components/model-selector/`
   - `TextModelDropdown.tsx` - Consumes TextModelSelectorContract
   - `VisionModelDropdown.tsx` - Consumes VisionModelSelectorContract  
   - `ModelSelectorPanel.tsx` - Unified interface combining both selectors

**Architecture Compliance:**
- Components only know about contracts, not implementations
- WebSocket events bridge backend features to frontend
- Clean separation between text and vision model selection

### üîÑ Phase 3: Integration Testing (CURRENT FOCUS)

**‚ö° CURRENT MILESTONE: UI Integration - Sidebar ModelSelector Integration**

**Progress Update:**
- ‚úÖ Component structure analyzed (App.tsx, DualPaneLayout.tsx, Sidebar.tsx)
- ‚úÖ ModelSelectorPanel component verified and ready for integration
- ‚úÖ Sidebar.tsx backed up for safe modification
- üîÑ IN PROGRESS: Integrating ModelSelectorPanel into Sidebar with collapsible interface
- ‚è≥ NEXT: Complete Sidebar modification and test model selector visibility

**Implementation Approach:**
- Adding collapsible "Models" section to Sidebar header
- Integrating TextModelSelector and VisionModelSelector hooks
- Maintaining clean UI/UX with existing Sidebar design patterns

**Objective:** Validate complete end-to-end model selection workflow

**Success Criteria:**
1. ‚úÖ Components integrated into main application UI
2. ‚úÖ WebSocket events flow from backend to frontend hooks
3. ‚úÖ Model dropdowns populate from registry data
4. ‚úÖ User selections persist across sessions
5. ‚úÖ Smart routing uses selected models appropriately
6. ‚úÖ Real-time availability updates work correctly
7. ‚úÖ Error handling with fallback suggestions

**Next Tasks:**
1. **UI Integration** - Add ModelSelectorPanel to application layout
2. **Event Flow Testing** - Verify backend-frontend WebSocket communication
3. **Model Registry Validation** - Test model population from registry service
4. **Persistence Testing** - Verify user preferences save/load correctly
5. **Smart Router Integration** - Confirm model selections influence routing decisions

## üîß Current Architecture Status

### Working Infrastructure
- **Backend:** Model selector features with full contract implementation
- **Frontend:** React components with WebSocket event handling
- **Event System:** Backend emits events, frontend hooks consume them
- **Model Registry:** Service provides available models to selectors
- **Smart Router:** Ready to consume model selection preferences

### Event Flow Pipeline
```

```

## üöÄ Phase 3 Implementation Plan

### 1. UI Integration
Add ModelSelectorPanel to main application interface for user access.

### 2. End-to-End Testing
Verify complete workflow from user interaction to smart routing integration.

### 3. Persistence Validation  
Test user preferences survive application restarts and browser sessions.

### 4. Real-Time Updates
Confirm model availability changes propagate to UI immediately.

### 5. Error Handling
Validate graceful fallbacks when models become unavailable.

**Architecture Advantage:** Clean phase separation allows focused testing of each integration layer independently. The contract-first approach ensures minimal context requirements for each component.
