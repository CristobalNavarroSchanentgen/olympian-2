# Olympian-2 AI-Native Codebase Status

## 🎯 Project Overview

Olympian-2 is an AI-native chat application with integrated MCP servers, vision processing, and artifact management. The architecture prioritizes context minimization - every feature can be understood by reading at most 3 files.

## ✅ CURRENT STATUS: BUSINESS LOGIC COMPLETE

### What is Implemented (96 TypeScript files)

**Core Architecture (69 files)**
- Models (13 files): Pure TypeScript interfaces
- Utils (10 files): Pure functions for token counting, context management, MCP protocol  
- Events (10 files): Fire-and-forget event schemas
- Services (8 files): Promise-based interfaces for external dependencies
- Config (9 files): Feature configuration schemas with validation
- Adapters (19 files): Feature-specific transformers (1 per feature, no sharing)

**Business Features (27 files)**  
- 9 Feature Contracts: Immutable interfaces defining capabilities
- 9 Feature Implementations: Complete business logic
- 9 Feature Tests: Contract boundary testing infrastructure

### Features Ready
- conversation-manager: CRUD, real-time updates, search
- message-processor: Processing, streaming, Ollama integration
- memory-manager: Context optimization, token budgets
- server-manager: MCP process lifecycle, health monitoring  
- tool-executor: Tool discovery, execution, security
- ollama-connector: Connection management, model operations
- model-detector: Capability detection, vision testing
- image-processor: Upload, processing, vision integration
- artifact-manager: Creation, versioning, validation

## 🚧 WHAT IS MISSING: INFRASTRUCTURE & UI

### Missing Infrastructure
- Monorepo structure: /packages/client, /packages/server, /packages/shared
- Docker setup: docker-compose.yml, container definitions
- Express server: HTTP API, WebSocket, dependency injection
- Database: MongoDB schemas, real adapter implementations
- MCP integration: Actual stdio process spawning

### Missing Frontend  
- React components: Chat interface, configuration panels
- Real-time UI: WebSocket integration, streaming display
- File management: Drag-and-drop, image previews
- Configuration UI: MCP management, model detection

## 📊 Progress Metrics
- Business Logic: 100% complete
- Architecture: 100% complete  
- Infrastructure: 0% (needs implementation)
- Frontend: 0% (needs implementation)
- Overall Project: ~40% complete

## 🚀 Next Steps
1. Monorepo setup with packages structure
2. Docker environment with MongoDB
3. Express server with real adapters
4. React frontend with components
5. Integration and testing

## 🎯 Architecture Status
✅ Context minimization achieved
✅ Perfect feature isolation  
✅ Immutable contracts defined
✅ Business logic complete
❌ Infrastructure needed
❌ UI implementation needed

Ready for infrastructure development phase.
