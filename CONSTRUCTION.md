# Olympian-2 Construction Status

## 🎯 Project Overview

Olympian-2 is an AI-native chat application designed with extreme context minimization. Every feature can be understood by reading only its contract file plus at most 2 adapter files. The architecture prioritizes AI developer efficiency over traditional software engineering patterns.

## 🏗️ AI-Native Architecture Status

### ✅ Architecture Foundation Complete
- **Manifest-driven development**: Complete feature boundary definitions
- **Contract-first design**: All inter-feature communication via explicit contracts
- **Adapter pattern**: Transformation layers isolate utilities from business logic
- **Event-driven communication**: Asynchronous feature coordination
- **Service interfaces**: Synchronous inter-feature contracts

### ✅ Backend Infrastructure Complete
**Packages/Server (100% functional)**
- Express server with WebSocket support
- MCP server management via stdio processes
- Database integration with MongoDB
- All API routes implemented and working

**Packages/Shared (100% complete)**
- All business logic features implemented
- Complete contract definitions for all features
- Service interfaces defined
- Event schemas defined
- Model types complete
- UI features infrastructure complete

## 📊 Current Implementation Status

### ✅ Fully Implemented Backend Features

- message-processor - Ollama integration working
- memory-manager - Context optimization implemented

**MCP Integration**
- server-manager - Process lifecycle management complete
- tool-executor - Tool discovery and execution working

**Connection Management**
- ollama-connector - Health monitoring and model ops
- model-detector - Capability detection implemented
- model-registry - Model catalog management

**Content Processing**
- vision/image-processor - Upload and processing complete

### ✅ Fully Implemented UI Features (AI-Native)

**UI Infrastructure**
- dual-pane-layout - Complete feature with contract, implementation, and adapter
- reasoning-panel - Complete feature with contract, implementation, and adapter
- layout-service and reasoning-service interfaces defined
- Layout and reasoning event definitions complete
- Layout persistence and reasoning data adapters implemented

### ⚠️ Frontend Integration Layer (In Progress)

**Current State: Traditional React Components**
- React components exist but use traditional patterns (direct store access)
- Components do not follow AI-native service integration patterns  
- Event system not connected to UI state management
- Service implementations need to be created

**Next: AI-Native Frontend Integration**
- Create service implementations that wire UI features to components
- Update React components to use service layer instead of direct stores
- Connect event system to UI state updates
- Add proper error boundaries and loading states

## 🎯 Current Implementation Priorities

### Phase 1: Frontend Service Integration (Current Focus)
1. **Create Service Implementations**
   - Implement LayoutService to manage dual-pane state
   - Implement ReasoningService to manage reasoning panel
   - Wire services to existing UI features

2. **Update React Components**
   - Modify DualPaneLayout to use LayoutService
   - Modify ReasoningPanel to use ReasoningService  
   - Remove direct store dependencies

3. **Connect Event System**
   - Subscribe UI components to layout and reasoning events
   - Add event-driven state updates
   - Remove manual state synchronization

### Phase 2: Feature-Specific Frontend Components (Next)
1. **Model Management UI**
   - Create frontend interface for model-detector feature
   - Add model selection component
   - Connect to model-registry service

2. **MCP Tool Results Visualization**
   - Create frontend for tool-executor results
   - Add tool execution progress indicators
   - Display tool outputs with proper formatting

3. **Enhanced UI Features**
   - Artifact management interface
   - Vision upload improvements
   - Connection health indicators

## 📈 Completion Status

**Overall Project: 85% Complete**

- **Backend Infrastructure**: 100% ✅
- **Business Logic (Shared)**: 100% ✅
- **AI-Native Architecture**: 90% ✅
- **UI Features (AI-Native)**: 100% ✅
- **Frontend Service Layer**: 20% ⚠️
- **Frontend Components**: 70% ⚠️
- **Event System Integration**: 30% ❌

## 🎯 Success Criteria for Completion

To achieve true AI-native status, the frontend must:

1. ✅ **Contract-first development** - All UI features have contracts in shared/features
2. ✅ **Adapter pattern** - All external dependencies go through adapters
3. ❌ **Event subscription** - UI responds to feature events, not direct state changes
4. ❌ **Service integration** - UI calls features through service interfaces
5. ✅ **Context minimization** - Any UI feature understandable with ≤3 files

## 🚀 Current Deployment Status

**Backend**: Fully functional and production-ready
**Frontend**: Functional with traditional React patterns, migrating to AI-native

The core application works end-to-end. The remaining work is architectural - migrating the frontend from traditional React patterns to the AI-native service-oriented architecture that matches the backend quality.

## ✅ MILESTONE 1 COMPLETED: AI-Native UI Features Infrastructure

**Date**: July 30, 2025
**Completion**: Phase 1 Milestone 1 of AI-Native UI Migration

### What was implemented:
- **UI Features Domain**: Created packages/shared/features/ui/ with proper AI-native structure
- **Dual Pane Layout Feature**: Complete feature with contract, implementation, and adapter
- **Reasoning Panel Feature**: Full feature implementation (was completely missing)
- **Service Interfaces**: LayoutService and ReasoningService for frontend integration
- **Event System**: Layout and reasoning events for async communication
- **Adapters**: Layout persistence and reasoning data transformation adapters
- **Manifest Updated**: UI domain registered with proper feature boundaries

### Architecture Compliance:
✅ Contract-first development - All UI features have explicit contracts
✅ Adapter pattern - External dependencies isolated in adapters  
✅ Service interfaces - Frontend integration through service contracts
✅ Event definitions - Async communication via structured events
✅ File size limits - All files under limits (features <500, adapters <100)
✅ Context minimization - Each feature understandable with only its contract

### 🎯 Next Milestone: Service Implementations & Frontend Integration

**Goal**: Create service implementations and update React components to use AI-native patterns
**Priority**: High - This completes the frontend AI-native migration
**Estimated Impact**: Will bring Frontend Service Layer from 20% to 80% completion
