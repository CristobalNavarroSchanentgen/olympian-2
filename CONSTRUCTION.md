- Implement missing service dependencies (model registry, adapters)
- Configure event publishing for routing events
- Test end-to-end smart routing functionality

**Required Components:**
- **Server Main:** Update dependency injection and service initialization
- **Service Registration:** Ensure all smart router dependencies are available
- **Adapter Implementation:** Verify content analysis, model selection, and availability adapters
- **Event System:** Configure event publishing for model routing events
- **Integration Testing:** Verify smart routing works with live Ollama models
\**Location:** `packages/server/src/websocket/`

**Goals:**
- Update chat handler to use smart model router
- Connect UI components to backend smart router service
- Model selection persistence across sessions
- Real-time model availability updates to clients
- Enhanced error handling and fallback messaging

**Implemented Features:**
- **Smart Model Router Integration:** WebSocket handler now uses intelligent content analysis for model selection
- **Real-time Model Availability:** Live monitoring and health checking of all 8 models
- **Enhanced Error Handling:** Automatic fallback routing when primary model fails
- **User Preference Support:** Persistent model preferences across chat sessions
- **Content Analysis Endpoints:** Real-time model recommendations based on message content
- **Extended System Status:** Model health information included in status updates

**WebSocket Events Added:**
- **models:availability:** Real-time model health and availability status
- **models:list:** Complete model registry with capabilities
- **model:recommend:** AI-powered content analysis and model suggestions
- **model:selected:** Smart routing results and reasoning
- **chat:fallback:** Automatic fallback notifications with strategy info
- **chat:started:** Enhanced chat start events with selected model info

**Smart Routing Features:**
- **Vision Detection:** Automatically routes multimodal content to vision models
- **Capability Matching:** Matches complex queries to models with tools/reasoning
- **Performance Optimization:** Considers model response times and availability
- **Graceful Degradation:** Seamless fallback when preferred models unavailable
- **Session Persistence:** Remembers last used model per conversation

**Components:**
- **Enhanced WebSocketHandler:** Complete integration with SmartModelRouter service
- **Model Health Monitoring:** Real-time availability checking and status reporting
- **Fallback Management:** Intelligent error recovery with alternative model selection
- **Event Broadcasting:** Real-time updates to all connected clients

## üéØ Registry Models (8 Available)
