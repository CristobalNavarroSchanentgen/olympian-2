# Olympian AI Production Roadmap

## 🎯 Current Status: PHASE 1 COMPLETE ✅
**✅ Infrastructure:** MongoDB + Client build successfully  
**✅ Server:** TypeScript compilation FIXED - builds successfully!
**🔄 Next Goal:** Docker deployment and basic functionality testing

---

## 🎉 MAJOR MILESTONE ACHIEVED - Phase 1 Complete!

### ✅ Phase 1: Server Compilation Fixes - COMPLETE
**Status:** ALL CRITICAL PATH ISSUES RESOLVED  
**Impact:** Server now builds successfully, ready for Docker deployment  
**Build Status:** 🟢 SUCCESS - Zero TypeScript errors

#### What Was Fixed:
- **✅ Missing Adapter Implementations:** All contract methods implemented
  - ModelSelectionAdapter: getCurrentSelection, updateSelection, validateSelection
  - AvailabilityAdapter: checkModelAvailability, getAvailableModels
  - ContentAnalysisAdapter: analyzeContent, detectMediaType
  - RouterEventPublisher: publishRouterEvent, publishModelSwitched

- **✅ Import & Reference Issues:** All paths and naming conflicts resolved
  - Fixed ModelCapabilityDefinition vs ModelCapability naming
  - Corrected @olympian/shared import paths
  - Cleaned up duplicate and malformed imports

- **✅ Service Architecture:** SmartModelRouter properly implemented
  - Service now implements interface directly
  - All dependencies properly injected
  - Type vs value confusion resolved

- **✅ AI-Native Architecture Maintained:** 
  - Contract-first development preserved
  - Feature isolation maintained
  - No direct feature-to-feature dependencies

## 🚀 PHASE 2: Docker Deployment Testing (CURRENT PRIORITY)

**Estimated Duration:** 1-2 hours  
**Status:** 🔄 READY TO START  
**Goal:** Verify end-to-end Docker deployment works

### 2.1 Docker Build Test
```bash
# Test server builds in Docker
docker-compose build server

# If successful, build full stack
docker-compose build
```

### 2.2 Full Stack Deployment
```bash
# Deploy all services
docker-compose up -d

# Verify all containers running
docker-compose ps
```

### 2.3 Service Health Check
```bash
# Test server health
curl http://localhost:3001/health

# Test client accessibility
curl http://localhost:3000

# Check logs for errors
docker-compose logs server
docker-compose logs client
```

### 2.4 Basic Functionality Test
- Open browser to http://localhost:3000
- Test WebSocket connection establishment
- Send a simple chat message
- Verify model selection interface works
- Check for any runtime errors in browser console

### Success Criteria for Phase 2:
- ✅ Docker containers build successfully
- ✅ All services start and stay running
- ✅ WebSocket connections establish
- ✅ Basic chat interface loads
- ✅ No critical errors in logs

---

## 🎯 PHASE 3: Production Optimization (FUTURE)

**Estimated Duration:** 1-2 days  
**Status:** ⏳ WAITING FOR PHASE 2  

### 3.1 Service Integration Enhancement
- Improve Ollama service integration
- Enhance model registry functionality
- Optimize smart model router performance

### 3.2 Production Configuration
- Environment configuration optimization
- Docker security hardening
- Performance monitoring setup
- Error handling improvements

### 3.3 Advanced Features
- Enhanced model selection algorithms
- Improved content analysis
- Better fallback strategies
- Comprehensive logging

## 📅 Timeline

**Total Remaining: 2-3 days** ⬇️ (reduced from original 4-6 days)

- **✅ Day 1:** Server compilation fixes (COMPLETE)
- **🔄 Day 2:** Docker deployment & basic functionality (IN PROGRESS)
- **Day 3:** Production optimization & advanced features
- **Day 4:** Buffer for integration issues

**Minimum Viable Production:** End of Day 2  
**Full Feature Complete:** End of Day 3

## 🔄 IMMEDIATE NEXT ACTIONS

**START HERE - Phase 2 Docker Testing:**

1. **Test Docker Build:**
   ```bash
   cd /Users/cristobalnavarro/Desktop/olympian-2
   docker-compose build server
   ```

2. **If build succeeds, deploy:**
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

3. **Verify deployment:**
   ```bash
   docker-compose ps
   curl http://localhost:3001/health
   ```

4. **Test in browser:**
   - Go to http://localhost:3000
   - Test basic chat functionality

5. **Check for issues:**
   ```bash
   docker-compose logs server
   docker-compose logs client
   ```
