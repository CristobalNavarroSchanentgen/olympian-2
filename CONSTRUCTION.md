# Olympian AI-Native Codebase Construction Log

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Philosophy

This project follows an **AI-native architecture** that treats context minimization as the primary constraint. Every file must be completely understandable with at most three other files as context: its contract, its test, and the manifest entry.

## ‚úÖ COMPLETED LAYERS
