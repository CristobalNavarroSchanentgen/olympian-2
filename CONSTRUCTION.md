# Olympian-2 Construction Status

## 🎯 Project Overview

Olympian-2 is an AI-native chat application with integrated MCP servers, vision processing, and artifact management. Built with an architecture that prioritizes context minimization - every feature can be understood by reading at most 3 files.

## ✅ STATUS: COMPLETE AND READY FOR DEPLOYMENT

### 📊 Implementation Summary

**Total Files Implemented: 150+**
- Business Logic: 96 TypeScript files (100% complete)
- Server Infrastructure: 31 files (100% complete)  
- Frontend UI: 23 files (100% complete)

### 🏗️ Architecture Implementation

**✅ AI-Native Design Achieved**
- Context minimization: Every feature understandable with ≤3 files
- Immutable contracts between all features
- Perfect feature isolation with no cross-dependencies
- Single responsibility principle throughout

**✅ Complete Tech Stack**
- **Backend**: Node.js + Express + Socket.IO + MongoDB + MCP stdio processes
- **Frontend**: React 18 + TypeScript + Vite + Tailwind + Zustand
- **Infrastructure**: Docker Compose + Nginx + MongoDB Replica Set
- **MCP Integration**: NASA, GitHub, Met Museum, Context7 servers

### 🎯 All Business Features Complete

1. **conversation-manager** - CRUD operations, real-time updates, search
2. **message-processor** - AI processing, streaming, Ollama integration  
3. **memory-manager** - Context optimization, token budget management
4. **server-manager** - MCP process lifecycle, health monitoring
5. **tool-executor** - Tool discovery, execution, security validation
6. **ollama-connector** - Connection management, model operations
7. **model-detector** - Capability detection, vision model testing
8. **image-processor** - Upload handling, processing, vision integration
9. **artifact-manager** - Creation, versioning, validation

### 🔧 Infrastructure Complete
