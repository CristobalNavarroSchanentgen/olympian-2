# Olympian AI - Dual-Pane UI Architecture

## Overview
The Olympian AI interface has been transformed to feature a modern dual-pane layout with navy/blue color scheme, designed specifically for AI-assisted development workflows.

## Architecture Components

### Primary Layout Components

#### DualPaneLayout (Main Container)
- Location: /packages/client/src/components/ui/DualPaneLayout.tsx
- Contract: /features/ui/dual-pane-layout/contract.ts
- Orchestrates the entire interface using React composition patterns

#### ApplicationHeader (Fixed Navigation)  
- Olympian AI branding with icon
- Dual model selectors (Text & Vision)
- Auto-detect toggle
- Navigation controls (History, Connections, MCP)

#### ConversationPanel (Left Pane)
- Integrates MessageList, MessageInput, and ReasoningPanel
- Demonstrates component composition patterns
- Uses lifting state up for coordinated behavior

#### ReasoningPanel (Expandable AI Insights)
- Expandable thought process display with metadata
- Structured reasoning blocks (Planning, Steps, Conclusions)
- Individual block expansion capabilities

#### CodeEditor (Right Pane)
- Syntax highlighting for multiple languages
- Line numbers display and copy functionality
- Pure component patterns for predictability

## Visual Design System

### Navy/Blue Color Scheme
- Deep navy background (--background: 222 47% 11%)
- Light text (--foreground: 213 31% 91%) 
- Bright blue accents (--primary: 217 91% 60%)
- Optimized for extended development sessions

### Component Styling
- Glass morphism effects with backdrop filters
- Smooth 200ms transitions for interactions
- Custom styled scrollbars for dark theme
- Syntax highlighting with color coding

## React Patterns Used

### Component Composition
Parent components orchestrate children without tight coupling

### Props Down, Events Up
Data flows down via props, events bubble up to parents

### Controlled Components
Parents manage state, children remain pure and predictable

## AI-Native Architecture Integration

### Feature Boundaries
UI components respect established AI-native boundaries defined in manifest.yaml

### Service Contracts
Components depend on contracts, not concrete implementations

### Adapter Pattern
External dependencies wrapped in adapters for clean separation

## Performance & Accessibility

### React Optimizations
- Component memoization to prevent unnecessary re-renders
- Callback memoization for stable function references  
- Lazy loading for components loaded on demand

### Accessibility Features
- Full keyboard navigation support
- Screen reader compatibility with semantic HTML
- High contrast ratios and focus indicators

## Developer Experience

### Component Development Workflow
1. Contract First: Define interfaces before implementation
2. Pure Components: Build testable, predictable components
3. Composition: Combine simple components into complex UIs
4. Service Integration: Connect through defined interfaces

The architecture provides predictable behavior, maintainable code, excellent performance, and a professional appearance optimized for AI-assisted development workflows.
