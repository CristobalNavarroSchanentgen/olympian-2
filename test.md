# OLYMPIAN-AI-LIGHTWEIGHT: BUILD RECOVERY STATUS

## CURRENT STATUS: Phase 3 - Adapter Interface Alignment 🔄

**Last Updated:** July 28, 2025  
**Build Status:** INTERFACE ALIGNMENT PROGRESS - Core interfaces fixed, adapter cleanup needed  
**Current Phase:** Phase 3 - Adapter Interface Alignment  
**Next Milestone:** Complete adapter reconstruction and achieve zero compilation errors

---

## WHAT'S BEEN COMPLETED ✅

### Phase 1 & 2: Foundation Complete ✅
- ✅ **Ollama adapter foundation** issues resolved
- ✅ **All utility implementations** complete with proper exports
- ✅ **Missing utility functions** expanded (process-manager, protocol-handler, image-processor, health-checker)

### Phase 3 Milestone 1: Core Model Fixes ✅ 
- ✅ **HealthCheckConfig import** resolved in server-config.ts
- ✅ **Duplicate function removal** from image-processor.ts  
- ✅ **ProcessInfo status enum** updated to include 'crashed' status
- ✅ **Health-checker signatures** corrected
- ✅ **ServerConfig interface** complete with all required properties
- ✅ **spawnProcess function** correct 3-parameter signature
- 📉 **Compilation errors reduced from 200+ to ~50** (75% improvement!)

### Phase 3 Milestone 2: Interface Alignment ✅ MAJOR PROGRESS
- ✅ **OllamaConnection interface** - Added endpoint and createdAt properties
- ✅ **HealthStatus interface** - Added adapter compatibility properties
- ✅ **HttpResponse interface** - Added missing ok property
- ✅ **ServiceStatus enum** - Added failed status value
- ✅ **Core interface conflicts** - RESOLVED (major compatibility achieved)
- 🔄 **Adapter cleanup** - health-monitor-adapter.ts needs reconstruction

---

## CURRENT FOCUS: Adapter Reconstruction & Cleanup

### Remaining Tasks:
1. **Reconstruct health-monitor-adapter.ts** - File corrupted during edits, needs clean rebuild
2. **Service contract completion** - Ensure all service interfaces have required methods
3. **ExecutionResult interface** - Add any missing properties adapters expect
4. **Final verification** - Achieve zero TypeScript compilation errors

### Current State:
- **Major interface mismatches:** ✅ RESOLVED
- **Core model compatibility:** ✅ ACHIEVED  
- **Adapter alignment:** 🔄 ~90% complete
- **File corruption:** 🔄 1 adapter file needs reconstruction

---

## SUCCESS CRITERIA

### Immediate Targets
- ❌ **Zero TypeScript compilation errors** (Progress: Major interface issues resolved)
- ❌ **health-monitor-adapter.ts** reconstructed and functional
- ❌ **All adapter interfaces aligned** with model definitions
- ❌ **Docker build passes** successfully  
- ❌ **Ready for production deployment**

### Architecture Compliance ✅ MAINTAINED
- **File Sizes:** All under AI-native limits
- **Isolation:** Features only know their contracts, not implementations  
- **Pure Utilities:** All utility functions remain context-free
- **Minimal Context:** Each file understandable in isolation

## WORKING APPROACH

**Current Directory:** /Users/cristobalnavarro/Desktop/olympian-2  
**Strategy:** Complete adapter reconstruction and final interface cleanup  
**Architecture:** AI-native with explicit contracts maintained  

**Progress Tracking:**
- Phase 1 & 2: ✅ Complete
- Phase 3 Milestone 1: ✅ Complete (Core model fixes)
- Phase 3 Milestone 2: ✅ Major Progress (Interface alignment ~90% complete)
- Phase 3 Milestone 3: 🔄 Starting (Adapter reconstruction & final cleanup)

---

## ESTIMATED COMPLETION

**Milestone 3 Total Time:** ~30-45 minutes
- health-monitor-adapter.ts reconstruction: 15-20 min
- Service contract gaps: 10-15 min  
- Final verification & cleanup: 10 min

**Ready for Production:** Within 1 hour from current state

---

## ARCHITECTURE SUCCESS

The AI-native architecture continues to prove effective:
- **Isolated failures:** Interface issues didnt cascade across the entire codebase
- **Systematic resolution:** Each interface fix targeted specific contracts  
- **Minimal context:** Fixes required understanding only the relevant contract files
- **Rapid iteration:** Major interface compatibility achieved in focused iterations

**Next Command:**
cd packages/shared && npx tsc --noEmit --project . 2>&1 | head -15

**Current Priority:** Reconstruct health-monitor-adapter.ts with clean, compatible implementation
