## 📋 PROJECT OVERVIEW

Olympian-AI-Lightweight is a sophisticated chat interface designed specifically for AI-assisted development. Built with AI-native architecture principles, it features integrated Model Context Protocol (MCP) support, real-time conversation management, and advanced vision processing capabilities.

**Key Features (Planned):**
- 🤖 **MCP Integration** - Full Model Context Protocol support for tool execution
- 💬 **Advanced Chat** - Real-time messaging with context-aware memory management  
- 🔗 **Smart Connection** - Intelligent model detection and health monitoring
- 👁️ **Vision Processing** - Image upload, format conversion, and optimization
- 📦 **Artifact Management** - Version-controlled content with storage capabilities
- 🎨 **Dual-Pane UI** - Split layout with reasoning panel for AI transparency

## 🏛️ ARCHITECTURE OVERVIEW

### AI-Native Design Principles
The codebase follows strict AI-native patterns optimized for AI-assisted development:

1. **Pure Functional Structure** - All business logic in pure functions
2. **Explicit Contracts** - Clear interfaces define all feature boundaries  
3. **Minimal Context** - Each file understandable in isolation (<500 lines per feature)
4. **Zero Implementation Coupling** - Features only know their contracts
5. **Adapter Pattern** - Thin transformation layers between utilities and features

### Core Architecture Layers

#### ✅ **Completed Foundation**
- **Build System** - TypeScript + ES2022 modules across all packages
- **Contracts** (features/**/contract.ts) - Interface definitions for all features
- **Models** (models/) - Type definitions and domain objects  
- **Utils** (utils/) - Pure utility functions (token-counter, http-client, event-bus, etc.)
- **Services** (services/) - Interface definitions for inter-feature communication
- **Events** (events/) - Message schemas for async communication
- **Package Structure** - Client/Server/Shared monorepo with proper exports

#### 🚧 **Implementation Layer (Ready for Development)**
- **Features** (features/**/index.ts) - Business logic implementations
- **Adapters** (adapters/) - Utility transformation layers
- **Config** (config/) - Feature configuration schemas

## 📊 CURRENT PROJECT STATUS

### ✅ **Completed Infrastructure**
- [x] AI-native architecture foundation established
- [x] TypeScript build system operational across all packages
- [x] ES2022 module system configured and working
- [x] Docker containerization ready
- [x] Core utilities implemented (token-counter, http-client, event-bus, image-processor)
- [x] Domain models defined (chat, mcp, connection, vision, artifacts, ui)
- [x] Feature contracts established for all domains
- [x] Service interfaces defined
- [x] Event schemas ready
- [x] Package exports properly configured

### 🎯 **Ready for Feature Implementation**

Based on `manifest.yaml`, we have **6 domains** with **13 features** ready for implementation:

| Domain | Features | Priority | Status |
|---------|----------|----------|--------|
| **Connection** | ollama-connector, model-detector | 🔥 High | Ready - foundational |
| **Chat** | conversation-manager, message-processor, memory-manager | 🔥 High | Ready - core functionality |
| **MCP** | server-manager, tool-executor | 🚀 Medium | Ready - tool integration |
| **UI** | dual-pane-layout, reasoning-panel | 🚀 Medium | Ready - user interface |
| **Vision** | image-processor | ⚡ Low | Ready - enhancement |  
| **Artifacts** | artifact-manager | ⚡ Low | Ready - enhancement |

### 🏗️ **Implementation Roadmap**

**Phase 1: Core Foundation (Recommended Start)**
1. **Connection Domain** - Essential for any chat functionality
   - `ollama-connector` - Establish connection to Ollama
   - `model-detector` - Discover available models

**Phase 2: Chat Functionality** 
2. **Chat Domain** - Core user experience
   - `conversation-manager` - Handle chat sessions
   - `message-processor` - Process user/AI messages
   - `memory-manager` - Context and memory handling

**Phase 3: Advanced Features**
3. **MCP Integration** - Tool execution capabilities
4. **UI Enhancement** - Dual pane and reasoning panels  
5. **Vision & Artifacts** - Advanced capabilities

## 📁 DEVELOPMENT WORKFLOW

### Implementation Guidelines
```bash
# 1. Choose a feature from manifest.yaml
# 2. Read its contract file to understand the interface
# 3. Implement the feature following AI-native patterns:
#    - Keep feature files under 500 lines
#    - Keep adapter files under 100 lines
#    - Only import from contracts and service interfaces
#    - No direct coupling between feature implementations

# 4. Test the build
npm run build

# 5. Commit when successful
git add .
git commit -m "feat: implement [feature-name]"
```

### Architecture Guidelines
- **Features**: Only import from their contract file and service interfaces
- **Adapters**: Only transform data between utilities and features  
- **No Direct Coupling**: Features never import other feature implementations
- **Contract First**: All interfaces defined before implementation
- **Fail Fast**: Build must pass before commit

---

## 🎯 **NEXT STEPS**

**Current Status:** All build issues resolved ✅ Ready for feature development 🚀

**Recommended Starting Point:**
Begin with **Connection Domain** (`ollama-connector` + `model-detector`) as it provides the foundation for all other chat functionality.

**File Locations:**
- Contract: `features/connection/ollama-connector/contract.ts`
- Implementation: `features/connection/ollama-connector/index.ts` (to be created)
- Adapters: `adapters/features/connection/ollama-connector/` (to be created)

**Next Priority:** Implement Connection Domain features
