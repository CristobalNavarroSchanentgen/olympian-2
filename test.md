# OLYMPIAN-AI-LIGHTWEIGHT

## 🏗️ AI-Native Chat Interface with MCP Integration

**Status:** TypeScript Foundation ✅ | Docker Build 🚧 | Feature Implementation 🚧  
**Architecture:** AI-Native Functional Pattern  
**Build Status:** Server builds ✅ | Client module compatibility issue ❌

---

## 📋 PROJECT OVERVIEW

Olympian-AI-Lightweight is a sophisticated chat interface designed specifically for AI-assisted development. Built with AI-native architecture principles, it features integrated Model Context Protocol (MCP) support, real-time conversation management, and advanced vision processing capabilities.

**Key Features (Planned):**
- 🤖 **MCP Integration** - Full Model Context Protocol support for tool execution
- 💬 **Advanced Chat** - Real-time messaging with context-aware memory management  
- 🔗 **Smart Connection** - Intelligent model detection and health monitoring
- 👁️ **Vision Processing** - Image upload, format conversion, and optimization
- 📦 **Artifact Management** - Version-controlled content with storage capabilities

## 🏛️ ARCHITECTURE OVERVIEW

### AI-Native Design Principles
The codebase follows strict AI-native patterns optimized for AI-assisted development:

1. **Pure Functional Structure** - All business logic in pure functions
2. **Explicit Contracts** - Clear interfaces define all feature boundaries  
3. **Minimal Context** - Each file understandable in isolation (<500 lines per feature)
4. **Zero Implementation Coupling** - Features only know their contracts
5. **Adapter Pattern** - Thin transformation layers between utilities and features

### Core Architecture Layers

#### ✅ **Working Foundation**
- **Contracts** (features/**/contract.ts) - Interface definitions for all features
- **Models** (models/) - Type definitions and domain objects
- **Utils** (utils/) - Pure utility functions (token-counter, http-client, etc.)
- **Services** (services/) - Interface definitions for inter-feature communication
- **Events** (events/) - Message schemas for async communication

#### 🚧 **Implementation Layer (In Progress)**
- **Features** (features/**/index.ts) - Business logic implementations
- **Adapters** (adapters/) - Utility transformation layers
- **Config** (config/) - Feature configuration schemas

## 🔧 TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS  

### Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: React + TypeScript + Vite
- **Backend**: Node.js + Express + TypeScript  
- **Database**: MongoDB
- **Communication**: WebSockets, HTTP
- **Containerization**: Docker Compose

### Build System Status
- ✅ **Shared Package Build** - TypeScript compilation successful
- ✅ **Server Package Build** - Builds successfully with all dependencies
- ✅ **Dependency Resolution** - All imports resolve correctly
- ✅ **Basic Architecture** - Contracts and utilities working

**Last Updated:** July 30, 2025  
**Next Priority:** Resolve client build module compatibility issue

## 🚀 GETTING STARTED

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 20+
- Docker Desktop
- 8GB+ RAM recommended

### Quick Start
```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Build shared package
npm run build --workspace=packages/shared    # ✅ Works

# Start with Docker (recommended)  
docker-compose up --build

# Or start development environment
npm run dev
```

### Testing Build
```bash
# Test Docker build (currently fails at client step)
docker-compose build

# Test individual packages
npm run build --workspace=packages/shared    # ✅ Works
npm run build --workspace=packages/server    # ✅ Works  
npm run build --workspace=packages/client    # ❌ Module compatibility issue
```

## 📊 CURRENT PROJECT STATUS

### ✅ **Completed Infrastructure**
- [x] AI-native architecture foundation
- [x] TypeScript build system working
- [x] Docker containerization operational
- [x] Core utilities implemented (token-counter, http-client, image-processor)
- [x] Domain models defined (chat, mcp, connection, vision, artifacts)
- [x] Feature contracts established
- [x] Build pipeline functional

### 🚧 **Implementation Progress**

| Domain | Contracts | Utils | Implementation | Status |
|---------|-----------|-------|----------------|--------|
| Chat | ✅ | ✅ | 🚧 | Contracts ready, impl needs fixes |
| MCP | ✅ | ✅ | 🚧 | Contracts ready, impl needs fixes |
| Connection | ✅ | ✅ | 🚧 | Contracts ready, impl needs fixes |
| Vision | ✅ | ✅ | 🚧 | Basic structure, needs completion |
| Artifacts | ✅ | ✅ | 🚧 | Contracts ready, impl needs fixes |

### 🎯 **Next Development Phase**
The foundation is solid with working build system and clear contracts. Next steps:

1. **Implement Feature Logic** - Fill in feature implementations following contracts
2. **Add Missing Dependencies** - Complete adapter interfaces and service implementations  
3. **Fix Contract Mismatches** - Align implementations with contract definitions
4. **Test Integration** - Validate end-to-end functionality
5. **Add Missing Models** - Complete type definitions as needed

## 📁 DEVELOPMENT WORKFLOW

### Making Changes
```bash
# 1. Test build first
docker-compose build

# 2. Make changes following AI-native patterns
# 3. Keep features under 500 lines
# 4. Keep adapters under 100 lines
# 5. Test build again

# 6. Commit when build passes
git add .
git commit -m "Description of changes"
```

### Architecture Guidelines
- **Features**: Only import from their contract file and service interfaces
- **Adapters**: Only transform data between utilities and features  
- **No Direct Coupling**: Features never import other feature implementations
- **Contract First**: Define interfaces before implementation
- **Fail Fast**: Build must pass before commit

---

## 🛠️ TROUBLESHOOTING

### Known Issues
- **Client Build Failure**: CommonJS/ES module compatibility in eventBus import
- **Docker Build Failure**: Stops at client package build step
- **Adapter Imports**: Some adapter imports temporarily commented out

### Getting Help
- Check `manifest.yaml` for feature dependencies
- Review contract files for interface definitions
- Follow AI-native patterns in existing working code
