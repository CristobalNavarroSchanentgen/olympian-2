# OLYMPIAN-AI-LIGHTWEIGHT: BUILD RECOVERY STATUS

## CURRENT STATUS: Phase 3 - Adapter Interface Alignment üîÑ

**Last Updated:** July 28, 2025  
**Build Status:** MAJOR PROGRESS - Core model issues resolved, ~50 adapter errors remain  
**Current Phase:** Phase 3 - Adapter Interface Alignment  
**Next Milestone:** Fix remaining adapter interface mismatches for zero compilation errors

---

## WHAT'S BEEN COMPLETED ‚úÖ

### Phase 1 & 2: Foundation Complete ‚úÖ
- ‚úÖ **Ollama adapter foundation** issues resolved
- ‚úÖ **All utility implementations** complete with proper exports
- ‚úÖ **Missing utility functions** expanded (process-manager, protocol-handler, image-processor, health-checker)

### Phase 3 Milestone 1: Core Model Fixes ‚úÖ 
- ‚úÖ **HealthCheckConfig import** resolved in server-config.ts
- ‚úÖ **Duplicate function removal** from image-processor.ts  
- ‚úÖ **ProcessInfo status enum** updated to include 'crashed' status
- ‚úÖ **Health-checker signatures** corrected
- ‚úÖ **ServerConfig interface** already had all required properties
- ‚úÖ **spawnProcess function** already had correct 3-parameter signature
- üìâ **Compilation errors reduced from 200+ to ~50** (75% improvement!)

## CURRENT ISSUES: ~50 Targeted Adapter Errors

### Pattern Analysis of Remaining Errors:

**1. OllamaConnection Interface Mismatches (15 errors)**
- Adapters expect `endpoint: string` property (not in current model)
- Adapters expect different constructor signatures

**2. HealthStatus Interface Mismatches (12 errors)**
- Adapters expect `healthy: boolean` property instead of `status: HealthLevel`
- Adapters expect `responseTime: number` and `error: string` properties

**3. Service Interface Gaps (8 errors)**
- Missing method implementations in service contracts
- Function signature mismatches between contracts and implementations

**4. Execution Result Interface Issues (10 errors)**
- ExecutionResult missing properties that adapters expect
- Different return types between contracts and implementations

**5. Minor Property/Method Mismatches (5 errors)**
- Missing properties in various model interfaces
- Method name inconsistencies

---

## METHODICAL NEXT STEPS

### **Milestone 2: Adapter Interface Alignment**

**Step 1: Fix OllamaConnection Model (20 minutes)**
```typescript
// Add missing 'endpoint' property to OllamaConnection interface
// Align constructor signatures with adapter expectations
```

**Step 2: Align HealthStatus Interface (15 minutes)**  
```typescript
// Add computed properties or modify adapters to use correct status interface
// Fix health check result transformations
```

**Step 3: Complete Service Contracts (20 minutes)**
```typescript
// Add missing method signatures to service interfaces
// Ensure all adapters implement required methods
```

**Step 4: Fix ExecutionResult Interface (10 minutes)**
```typescript
// Add missing properties that adapters expect
// Align return types between contracts and implementations
```

**Step 5: Final Verification (10 minutes)**
```bash
cd packages/shared && npx tsc --noEmit --project .
```

## SUCCESS CRITERIA

### Immediate Targets
- ‚ùå **Zero TypeScript compilation errors** (Currently: ~50 errors)
- ‚ùå **All adapter interfaces aligned** with model definitions
- ‚ùå **Docker build passes** successfully  
- ‚ùå **Ready for production deployment**

### Architecture Compliance ‚úÖ MAINTAINED
- **File Sizes:** All under AI-native limits (<500 lines features, <100 lines adapters)
- **Isolation:** Features only know their contracts, not implementations  
- **Pure Utilities:** All utility functions remain context-free
- **Minimal Context:** Each file understandable in isolation

---

## WORKING APPROACH

**Current Directory:** `/Users/cristobalnavarro/Desktop/olympian-2`  
**Strategy:** Target remaining ~50 errors systematically by interface type  
**Architecture:** AI-native with explicit contracts maintained  

**Progress Tracking:**
- Phase 1 & 2: ‚úÖ Complete
- Phase 3 Milestone 1: ‚úÖ Complete (Core model fixes)
- Phase 3 Milestone 2: üîÑ In Progress (Adapter alignment)

---

## ESTIMATED COMPLETION

**Milestone 2 Total Time:** ~75 minutes
- OllamaConnection fixes: 20 min
- HealthStatus alignment: 15 min  
- Service contract completion: 20 min
- ExecutionResult fixes: 10 min
- Final verification: 10 min

**Ready for Production:** Within 2 hours from current state

---

## ARCHITECTURE SUCCESS

The AI-native architecture is proving effective:
- **Isolated failures:** Model issues didn't cascade across features
- **Focused fixes:** Each error targets specific interface contracts  
- **Minimal context:** Fixes require understanding only the specific contract file
- **Rapid iteration:** 75% error reduction in first milestone

**Next Command:**
```bash
cd packages/shared && npx tsc --noEmit --project . 2>&1 | head -20
```
