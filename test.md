### Progress Update: CORE MODELS CREATED âœ…

#### Completed
1. **Fixed Import Paths** - Removed .js extensions from TypeScript imports
2. **Created Core Models** - Built essential type definitions:
   - âœ… artifacts/artifact.ts, artifacts/version.ts
   - âœ… chat/conversation.ts, chat/message.ts, chat/memory-context.ts 
   - âœ… mcp/server-config.ts, mcp/tool-definition.ts, mcp/execution-result.ts
   - âœ… connection/ollama-connection.ts, connection/model-capability.ts, connection/health-status.ts
   - âœ… vision/image-data.ts, vision/processing-result.ts

3. **Created Core Utilities** - Built foundational functions:
   - âœ… token-counter.ts, artifact-validator.ts, context-manager.ts
   - âœ… capability-detector.ts, health-checker.ts, http-client.ts
   - âœ… process-manager.ts, protocol-handler.ts, image-processor.ts
   - ðŸ”„ config-parser.ts (needs type fixes)

#### Current Issues (Fixing)
- config-parser.ts: Type mismatches with servers vs mcpServers
- http-client.ts: Method signature issues
- Many adapter files have implementation vs interface mismatches

#### Strategy: MINIMAL BUILD FIRST
- Focus on getting shared package to compile with core models/utils
- Fix adapter implementation mismatches after core builds
- Test basic functionality before fixing all features

#### Next Steps
1. Fix remaining utility compilation errors  
2. Build shared package successfully
3. Test server package compilation
4. Fix feature implementations gradually
5. Docker builds after all packages compile

### Architecture Status
Following AI-Native principles:
- âœ… Core models < 100 lines each
- âœ… Utilities are pure functions  
- âœ… Clear type definitions
- ðŸ”„ Adapter implementations need alignment with contracts
